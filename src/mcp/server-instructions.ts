export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `# Codegraph — code intelligence over an indexed knowledge graph

Codegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file
in the workspace. Reads are sub-millisecond; the index lags writes by
about a second through the file watcher. Consult it BEFORE writing or
editing code, not during.

## Answer directly — don't delegate exploration

For "how does X work", architecture, trace, or where-is-X questions,
answer DIRECTLY using 2-3 codegraph calls: \`codegraph_context\` first,
then ONE \`codegraph_explore\` for the source of the symbols it surfaces.
Codegraph IS the pre-built search index — so delegating the lookup to a
separate file-reading sub-task/agent, or running your own grep + read
loop, repeats work codegraph already did and costs more for the same
answer. Reach for raw Read/Grep only to confirm a specific detail
codegraph didn't cover. A direct codegraph answer is typically a handful
of calls; a grep/read exploration is dozens.

## Tool selection by intent

- **"How does X work? / trace X end to end / explain the Y system / architecture?"** → \`codegraph_explore\` (PRIMARY for understanding — seed it with the key symbol names, read its output, don't grep+Read your way there)
- **"What is the symbol named X? / where is X defined?"** → \`codegraph_search\` (pinpoint lookups)
- **"What's the deal with this task / feature / area?"** → \`codegraph_context\` (lighter composed view of search + node + callers + callees)
- **"What calls this?"** → \`codegraph_callers\`
- **"What does this call?"** → \`codegraph_callees\`
- **"What would changing this break?"** → \`codegraph_impact\`
- **"Show me this symbol's source / signature / docstring."** → \`codegraph_node\`
- **"Show me several related symbols' source / survey an area."** → \`codegraph_explore\` (ONE capped call; prefer over many codegraph_node/Read)
- **"What's in directory X?"** → \`codegraph_files\`
- **"Is the index ready / what's its size?"** → \`codegraph_status\`

## Common chains

- **Understanding / onboarding**: feed \`codegraph_explore\` the key symbol/file names and read its output (line-numbered source from many files in one call). If the question names nothing concrete, do ONE quick \`codegraph_search\` / \`codegraph_context\` to surface the names, then explore with them. Fill remaining gaps with \`codegraph_node\` / Read — don't drop back to grep+Read for the whole topic.
- **Refactor planning**: \`codegraph_search\` → \`codegraph_callers\` → \`codegraph_impact\`. The blast-radius answer comes from impact, not from walking callers manually.
- **Debugging a regression**: \`codegraph_callers\` of the suspected symbol; widen with \`codegraph_impact\` if an unexpected call appears.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't search-then-Read your way through an understanding question** — feed the names you find into \`codegraph_explore\` instead of Reading the files one by one; it does that whole loop in one call and returns line numbers you can cite directly.
- **Don't grep first** when looking up a symbol by name — \`codegraph_search\` is faster and returns kind + location + signature.
- **Don't reach for \`codegraph_explore\` on a pinpoint "where is X defined" lookup** — \`codegraph_search\` is one cheap call.
- **Don't chain \`codegraph_search\` + \`codegraph_node\`** when you just want context — \`codegraph_context\` is one round-trip.
- **Don't loop \`codegraph_node\` over many symbols** — one \`codegraph_explore\` call returns them all grouped by file, while each separate call re-reads the whole context and costs far more. Use \`codegraph_node\` for a single symbol.
- **Don't query the index immediately after editing a file** — the watcher needs ~500ms to debounce + sync. Wait for the next turn.

## Limitations

- Index lags file writes by ~1 second.
- Cross-file resolution is best-effort name matching; ambiguous calls may return multiple candidates.
- No live correctness validation — that's still the TypeScript compiler / test suite / linter's job. Codegraph supplements those with structural context they don't have.
