description: CodeGraph is zero-config by default, with one optional codegraph.json for custom extensions and indexing nested git repositories.
---

Next to none — CodeGraph is **zero-config by default**, with nothing to write or keep in sync to get started. Language support is automatic from the file extension; there's nothing to wire up per language. The one optional file, `codegraph.json`, covers [custom file extensions](#custom-file-extensions) and [indexing nested git repositories](#indexing-nested-git-repositories).

## What it skips out of the box

- **Dependency, build, and cache directories** — `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.venv`, `Pods`, `.next`, and the like across every [supported stack](/codegraph/reference/languages/) — so the graph is your code, not third-party noise. This holds even with no `.gitignore`.
- **Anything in your `.gitignore`** — honored in git repos via git, and in non-git projects by reading `.gitignore` directly (root and nested).
- **Files larger than 1 MB** — generated bundles, minified JS, vendored blobs.

## Excluding or including more

To keep something else out, add it to `.gitignore`. To pull a default-excluded directory back **in** (e.g. you really want a vendored dependency indexed), add a negation — `!vendor/`.

The defaults apply uniformly, so committing a dependency or build directory doesn't force it into the graph — the `.gitignore` negation is the explicit opt-in.

## Custom file extensions

If your project uses a non-standard extension for a [supported language](/codegraph/reference/languages/) — say `.dota_lua` for Lua, or `.tpl` for PHP — those files are skipped by default, because the extension isn't one CodeGraph recognizes. Map them with an optional `codegraph.json` at your project root:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    ".dota_lua": "lua",
    ".tpl": "php"
  }
}
```

Each value is a supported language id. The mappings merge on top of the built-in defaults and win on conflict, so you can also re-point a built-in (e.g. `".h": "cpp"`). Commit the file to share the mapping with your team.

A typo'd language or a malformed file is warned about and skipped — it never breaks indexing — and a project with no `codegraph.json` behaves exactly as before. Re-index (`codegraph index`) after adding or changing mappings.

## Indexing nested git repositories

CodeGraph respects your `.gitignore`, so a directory you've gitignored stays out of the graph — **including any git repositories nested inside it.** If you keep cloned reference projects, vendored copies, or a folder of unrelated repos in a gitignored directory (a `resource/`, `.repos/`, or `examples/` dir), CodeGraph leaves it untouched: it won't walk in, discover the embedded repos, or index them.

If instead you run a **"super-repo" of independent clones** — a workspace whose own `.gitignore` lists its child repos to keep `git status` quiet, where you genuinely want every child indexed into one graph — opt those directories back in with `includeIgnored`:

```json
{
  "includeIgnored": ["packages/", "services/"]
}
```

Each entry is a gitignore-style pattern naming a gitignored directory whose nested git repositories should be indexed anyway. CodeGraph descends into the directories you list and indexes each embedded repo by its own `git ls-files`, so every child repo's own `.gitignore` is still honored. Directories you don't list stay excluded.

A few things to know:

- **Untracked** nested repositories (ones you haven't gitignored) are indexed automatically — `includeIgnored` is only for the ones your `.gitignore` excludes.
- Built-in skips like `node_modules` are never re-included, even inside an opted-in directory.
- A project without this layout needs no `codegraph.json` at all.

Re-index (`codegraph index`) after adding or changing `includeIgnored`.

## Where data lives

Per-project data lives in a `.codegraph/` directory at your project root, containing the SQLite database (`codegraph.db`). Nothing leaves your machine.
